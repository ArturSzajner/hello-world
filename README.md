Just another repository

Hi everyone,

I'm Artur. I am going to be a software developer. I am 34 and have very little professional experience with programming. It is a real challenge to get a job in such profession. However I am familiar to programming languages and technologies such as: HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript, Ruby and very little of C, C#, Python, Java, PHP. Software develpment is what I want to do for life.
